# DSnP Test Cases
## Why 
Widely regarded as a must-take course in NTUEE, Data Structures and Programming, a.k.a **DSnP** has coding assignments that boasts the following features:

- Long spec
- Long code 
- TOO MANY error messages to handle

Debugging is no doubt a trial for all students. To ease the process, I've decided to collect custom test cases (single files or scripts) that is available to all students that may enroll in this course in the future.
